Develop an efficient autocomplete system by implementing BinarySearchAutocomplete and HashListAutocomplete, each using different data structures. Implement PrefixComparator and utility methods in BinarySearchLibrary. Test and benchmark each class using AutocompleteMain and JUnit tests, then analyze performance.
